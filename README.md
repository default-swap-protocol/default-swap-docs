# Overview

Default Swap Protocol provides decentralized protection against economic risks. While DeFi insurance focuses on contract risks and exchange hacks, Default Swap Protocol protects against economic risks such as loan liquidations \(in the case of over-collateralized lending\) and default events \(in the case of under-collateralized lending\).

By mitigating risk we hope to broaden access to DeFi lending to new borrowers who havenâ€™t been able to participate in over-collateralized lending.
