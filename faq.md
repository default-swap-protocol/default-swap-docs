## How is Default Swap Protocol different from insurance protocols?

Insurance protocols like Nexus Mutual and Cover are focused on mitigating contract risks and exchange hacks and employ governance mechanisms to decide on payouts. Default Swap Protocol is focused on mitigating economic risk including loan liquidations \(in the context of over-collateralized loans\) and default events \(in the context of under-collateralized loans\). In addition, the Default Swap Protocol makes a market for “insurance” that is paid out automatically upon a default event, thus removing human governance risk from the equation.
